# Code-Quiz-HW4


- This project was to make a Coding Quiz that will display a series of questions and allow the user to choose from answer choices. The quiz is timed and incorrect answers result in a penalty time deduction. Finishing the quiz successfully results in a score (equal to the remaining time) and the user can then post their score and initials to a Highscore list.
